# ImageManager concepts

Here are the main concepts needed to correctly use ImageManager. They are not hard to understand, but they are essential to operate not only ImageManager, but the dojot platform as well.

## Device

In dojot, a image is a digital representation of an actual image or gateway with one or more sensors or of a virtual one with sensors/attributes inferred from other images.

Consider, for instance, an actual image with temperature and humidity sensors; it can be represented into dojot as a image with two attributes (one for each sensor). We call this kind of image as regular image or by its communication protocol, for instance, MQTT image or CoAP image.

We can also create images which donâ€™t directly correspond to their actual ones, for instance, we can create one with higher level of information of temperature (is becoming hotter or is becoming colder) whose values are inferred from temperature sensors of other images. This kind of image is called virtual image.

The information model used for both "real" and virtual images is as following:

- Device:
  - id (string, read-only): this is the identifier that will be used when referring to this image
  - label (string, read-write, required): an user label to identify this image more easily
  - created (DateTime, read-only): image creation date
  - updated (DateTime, read-only): image update date
  - templates ([ string (template ID) ], read-write): list of template IDs to "assemble" this image (more on this on 'Template' section)
  - attrs ([ Attributes ], read-only): list of attributes currently set to this image.

- Attributes:
  - id (integer, read-write): attribute ID (automatically generated**)
  - label (string, read-write, required): user label for this attribute
  - created (DateTime, read-only): attribute creation date
  - updated (DateTime, read-only): attribute update date
  - type (string, read-write, required): attribute type ("static" or "dynamic")
  - value_type (string, read-write, required): attribute value type ("string", "float", "integer", "geo")
  - static_value (string, read-write): if this is a static attribute, which is its static value
  - template_id (string, read-write): from which template did this attribute come from.

*although the code allows the user to set this.

## Template

All images are created based on a *template*, which can be thought as a model of a image. As "model" we could think of part numbers or product models - one *prototype* from which images are created. Templates in dojot have one label (any alphanumeric sequence), a list of attributes which will hold all the image emitted information, and optionally a few special attributes which will indicate how the image communicates, including transmission methods (protocol, ports, etc.) and message formats.

In fact, templates can represent not only "image models", but it can also abstract a "class of images". For instance, we could have one template to represent all themometers that will be used in dojot. This template would have only one attribute called, let's say, "temperature". While creating the image, the user would select its "physical template", let's say *TexasInstr882*, and the 'thermometer' template. The user would have also to add translation instructions in order to map the temperature reading that will be sent from the image to a "temperature" attribute. 

In order to create a image, a user selects which templates are going to compose this new image. All their attributes are merged together and associated to it - they are tightly linked to the original template so that any template update will reflect all associated images.

The information model used for templates is:

- Template:
  - id (string, read-write  ): this is the identifier that will be used when referring to this template
  - label (string, read-write, required): an user label to identify this template more easily
  - created (DateTime, read-only): template creation date
  - updated (DateTime, read-only): template update date
  - attrs ([ Attributes ], read-write): list of attributes currently set to this template - it's the same as attributes from Device section.
